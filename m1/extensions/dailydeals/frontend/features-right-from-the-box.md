# Features right from the box

Look at what you get on frontend after you create deal. Screenshots are taken from
RWD theme:

* **Product page with deal timer**

* **Product listing page with deal timers** (can be turned off in extension
settings)

* **All products with active deals at this moment** (if you created deal but
there are still no products on page ***'Deals today'***, please check the root 
category - it should have option `Is anchored` set to `Yes`)

* If customer **adds to a cart the product with deal** and deal ends less than
in a 10 minutes, then he see the message in shopping cart next to product:
