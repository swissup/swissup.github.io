# Ajax Search

Our **Ajax search and autocomplete extension** improves the default Magento search with ajax autocomplete feature. It allows you to set up the ajax search by the following product’s attributes: SKU, description, shape, price, status, manufacture, meta keywords. You can also display CMS pages such as Contact Us, Terms and Conditions in popup window. The module comes with category filter combobox, customizable suggest popup, product display in search box and configurable input field settings.
