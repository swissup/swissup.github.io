# Helpmate

Helpmate consists of 2 tightly integrated modules:

**Help Desk** extension helps a dedicated support team to provide prompt support to store users.

**Knowledge Base** provides a categorised directory for frequently asked questions and answers.

Helpmate extension was created in order to allow you:

* to accept issues via e-mail, contact form or customer account page 24 hours per day & 7 days per week
* to help focus your support team on really important issues while ignoring inactive tickets
* to create knowledge articles based on already solved clients issues, which will allow your customers to help themselves without bothering your support team

Please review the following basic terms before using the extension.

`Support department` - allows to group your support team on separate departments in order to increase support efficiency.

`Admin Users` - specially designated staff which is responsible for answering requests. Each admin can participate in various support departments.

`Email Gateway` - divides emails with access via either pop3 or imap protocol. The feature allows to establish 2-way communication from user to specific support departments.

`Ticket` - is a separate issue posed by the customer and assigned to specific department. Ticket can be created via contact form, helpmate form, backend or via email.

`Notification email` - is an email which provides the notification about ticket updating both for admin and user.
