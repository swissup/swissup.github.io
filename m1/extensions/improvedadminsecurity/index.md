# Improved Admin Security

Our module offers you to use two-factor authentication based on the Google Authenticator application. Verification security code except username and password will be required every admin login attempt. In case the attackers get your admin username and password, they will not be able to access your store admin unless they have a security code provided by Google Authenticator. Important that the unique code expires in a short amount of time for security purposes.

Improved admin security extension consists of 2 tightly integrated modules:

**Two Factor Authentication** protects your Magento admin login area. The module is based on usage of verification key.
**Admin Watcher** enables checking the parameters of successful and failed attempts to access store backend.
