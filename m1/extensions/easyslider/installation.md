# Easy Slider installation instructions

Please follow next steps to complete the installation:

1. Go to store backend, navigate to `Admin > Tools > Compilation` and deactivate the compilation mode.
2. Go to your magento store root directory (via FTP or CPanel).
3. Create file `maintenance.flag` in root directory.
4. Open your store in browser. You have to see page `Service Temporarily Unavailable`. If you can not see this page, then probably you try to install extension at wrong magento instance. So, please, stop installation and try to find out where is your magento instance.
5. Unpack all files from extension archive into your magento store root directory.
6. Remove file `maintenance.flag` when copy process completed.
7. Login your store admin, refresh your magento store cache and start to configure extension.

Navigate to `System > Configuration > Templates-Master > Easy Slider` and
enable extension for any store you need.
