## Argento 1.8.1 - 1.8.2 Upgrade Using Installer

To switch to new `homepage` and `footer` please follow the next steps:

1. Delete deprecated footer template:

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/flat/template/page/html/footer.phtml
    ```

    > Cms block `footer` was renamed to `footer_cms` and new `footer_payments`
    > block was added.
    >
    > Old block `footer`is not used anymore,
    > so you can copy your custom content from it into new `footer_cms` block.

2. Reinstall ArgentoFlat theme:

    Go to `Templates Master > Modules`, press `Manage` for `TM_ArgentoFlat`
    design, select store view where you have theme installed and press `Run`.
    This will create new `homepage` and new static blocks.
    Backups will be created for old blocks and banners.

    If you've made homepage modifications, now you can copy your changes
    from `home_backup` to new `homepage`.

3.  Remove compatibility css:

-   open file

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/flat/layout/theme.xml
    ```

    and remove line 12 with code:

    ```xml
    <action method="addItem"><type>skin_css</type><name>css/old-flat.css</name></action>
    ```

-   delete css file `skin/frontend/argento/flat/css/old-flat.css`
