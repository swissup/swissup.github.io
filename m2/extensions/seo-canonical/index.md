# SEO Canonical URL

An excellent module that adds canonical URLs for products, categories, and CMS pages in Magento 2.

One of its best features is the ability to use the parent product URL as the canonical URL for child products. If a product is included in a configurable, bundle, or grouped product, you can force it to use the parent product URL as its canonical URL. This is especially useful for stores with very large product catalogs, where the store owner wants to consolidate Google indexing and avoid duplicate content.
