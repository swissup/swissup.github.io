# SEO URLs

Magento 2 allows store owners to build good sites and make them friendly for search engines out of the box.

Nevertheless, room for improvement always exists. Our SEO URLs extension for Magento 2 does just that. This extension makes your store better for search engines and real people.

Extension builds SEO friendly links for filters in layered navigation at category pages and at catalog search page. It reduces duplicated content at your store. Because extension always generates same URL for same filter set.
