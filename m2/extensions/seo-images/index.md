# SEO Images

The module helps maintain meaningful product image names. It allows you to generate product image names based on a product attribute; the most common use case is using the product name as the image name.

This extension does not modify any original image files. It renames resized images only.

The module has a minimal number of settings.

The only limitation is that the module works with the global configuration and cannot be configured per store view.
